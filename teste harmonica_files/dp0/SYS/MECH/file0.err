 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.281   TIME= 23:06:02
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.281   TIME= 23:06:02
 Contact element 127 is missing DOF VOLT (and possibly others) of        
 underlying base element 1.  Similar mismatches may exist elsewhere,     
 but checking for this is discontinued.                                  

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.312   TIME= 23:06:02
 Maximum contact stiffness 6.936879481E+16 is too big which can cause an 
 accuracy problem, you may scale the force units in the model.           

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.343   TIME= 23:06:02
 The modal analysis has non-zero displacements defined, which will cause 
 a load vector to be generated.  The load vector may be used by the      
 mode superposition analyses.  This feature is not documented.           

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.858   TIME= 23:06:02
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.874   TIME= 23:06:03
 Maximum contact stiffness 6.936879481E+16 is too big which can cause an 
 accuracy problem, you may scale the force units in the model.           

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.889   TIME= 23:06:03
 Maximum contact stiffness 6.936879481E+16 is too big which can cause an 
 accuracy problem, you may scale the force units in the model.
