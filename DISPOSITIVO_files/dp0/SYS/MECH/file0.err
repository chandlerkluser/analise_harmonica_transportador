 Contact element 1229 is missing DOF VOLT (and possibly others) of       
 underlying base element 268.  Similar mismatches may exist elsewhere,   
 but checking for this is discontinued.                                  

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.484   TIME= 04:34:28
 The modal analysis has non-zero displacements defined, which will cause 
 a load vector to be generated.  The load vector may be used by the      
 mode superposition analyses.  This feature is not documented.
