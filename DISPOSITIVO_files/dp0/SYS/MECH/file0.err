 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.359   TIME= 04:26:13
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.452   TIME= 04:26:13
 Contact element 9295 is missing DOF VOLT (and possibly others) of       
 underlying base element 138.  Similar mismatches may exist elsewhere,   
 but checking for this is discontinued.                                  

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.452   TIME= 04:26:13
 Maximum contact stiffness 1.328867165E+16 is too big which can cause an 
 accuracy problem, you may scale the force units in the model.           

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.640   TIME= 04:26:13
 The modal analysis has non-zero displacements defined, which will cause 
 a load vector to be generated.  The load vector may be used by the      
 mode superposition analyses.  This feature is not documented.
